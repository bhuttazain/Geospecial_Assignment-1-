        "\n",
        "### What is Geospatial Data?\n",
        "Geospatial data is any data that contains information about a specific **location on the Earth’s surface**. It usually includes geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) and may also include descriptive attributes (name, type, category, address, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Selected Dataset\n",
        "For this assignment, I selected a geospatial dataset from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**, a global and publicly available geographic database maintained by contributors, and extracted the data using the **Overpass API**, which allows location-based queries such as searching within a specified radius around a point. Specifically, my dataset contains the locations and attributes of car showrooms and dealerships in the radius of 30KM around KFUPM, collected using OSM tags like **shop=car and amenity=car_dealer**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset is useful because it supports practical spatial analysis tasks such as identifying where dealerships are concentrated (hotspots), understanding commercial clustering patterns along major roads, and assisting in business location analysis and urban/commercial planning decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Study Area (Location and Radius)\n",
        "- **Center location:** King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM), Saudi Arabia  \n",
        "- **Coordinates used:** `(26.307, 50.1459)` (latitude, longitude)  \n",
        "- **Search radius:** `30,000 meters (30 km)`\n",
        "\n",
        "This radius captures KFUPM and nearby surrounding cities/areas where car dealerships commonly exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Collection Method\n",
        "The dataset is collected by sending an **Overpass query** to extract objects tagged as:\n",
        "- `shop=car`  (car shops/showrooms)\n",
        "- `amenity=car_dealer` (car dealerships)\n",
        "\n",
        "The query includes three OSM object types:\n",
        "- **node** (single point location)\n",
        "- **way** (polygon/line feature; converted to center point using `out center`)\n",
        "- **relation** (complex features; converted to center point using `out center`)\n",
        "\n",
        "The query returns results in a GeoJSON-like structure (FeatureCollection), which is convenient for mapping and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Attributes Collected\n",
        "For each showroom/dealership, the following information is extracted (when available):\n",
        "- `name` (e.g., showroom name)\n",
        "- `brand` or `operator` (e.g., Toyota, Hyundai, etc.)\n",
        "- `addr:*` or `address` (street/address fields)\n",
        "- `phone` / `contact:phone`\n",
        "- `website` / `contact:website`\n",
        "- `latitude` and `longitude` (coordinates)\n",
        "- `osm_id` (unique identifier)\n",
        "\n",
        "These attributes provide both **spatial** (where it is) and **non-spatial** (what it is) information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "The selected dataset is a **public geospatial dataset** from OpenStreetMap, collected via Overpass API for a defined study region around KFUPM. Each record includes geographic coordinates and descriptive attributes, making it suitable for multiple spatial visualizations and analysis (choropleth, cartogram, bubble, hexbin, heatmap, and clustering).\n"

        "This allows printing results in a numbered list format (1, 2, 3, ...).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Step 5: Extract key information from each feature**\n",
        "For every showroom/dealership, I extracted important details such as:\n",

        "- `\"N/A\"` if phone/website is missing.\n",
        "\n",

        "I stored each processed showroom/dealership into a list called `showrooms_locations`.  \n",

        "\n",
        "### **Step 8: Print the results in list form**\n",

Visualization helps transform raw latitude/longitude points into meaningful patterns, making it easier to understand **where the showrooms are concentrated**, how they are distributed across the city, and whether they form **clusters or hotspots** along important roads or commercial areas.

        "   Then I converted them into a Pandas DataFrame (`df`) and removed any rows with missing latitude/longitude so that every record has valid coordinates, as explained in above step\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Created geospatial objects for mapping**  \n",
        "   For visualizations that required mapping and basemaps, I converted the DataFrame into a **GeoDataFrame** (using GeoPandas) and projected the data into **EPSG:3857** so that it aligns correctly with OpenStreetMap basemaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visualized the data using different methods (one by one)**  \n",
        "   For each method, I used the simplest possible library setup:\n",
        "   - Matplotlib / GeoPandas for static plots (choropleth, cartogram, hexbin)\n",
        "   - Contextily for adding basemap tiles\n",
        "   - Folium plugins for interactive maps (heat map and cluster map)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reported observations and insights**  \n",
        "   After each visualization, I added a markdown cell to explain what the map shows and what patterns can be observed.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this step, I used **Simulated Annealing (SA)** to compute a route between the start node (KFUPM) and the goal node (Lamborghini/Bentley showroom). Unlike BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra, Simulated Annealing is a **metaheuristic optimization algorithm** that searches for a good solution by gradually improving a candidate route. It works by starting with an initial route and then repeatedly generating small changes (neighbor solutions). At each step, SA may accept a better route, and it can also sometimes accept a worse route with a certain probability. This controlled acceptance of worse solutions helps the algorithm escape local optima. Over time, the algorithm reduces this probability using a **cooling schedule**, which makes the search more selective and stable as it progresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate Simulated Annealing, I recorded the **execution time** (process time) and computed the **total route cost** as the sum of road segment lengths (in meters), similar to the cost calculation used for Dijkstra. Since SA involves randomness, the final route may vary slightly between runs depending on the chosen parameters (such as the initial temperature, cooling rate, and number of iterations). The final route and its cost can then be compared with the other algorithms to understand the trade-off between **solution quality (distance)** and **computation effort**.\n",

        "*   **For Shortest Path (by Distance):** **Dijkstra's algorithm** is by far the superior choice. It is the fastest, guarantees the optimal path length, and provides a visually intuitive route.\n",
        "*   **For Shortest Path (by Number of Edges):** **BFS** is effective and fast, but the resulting path may not be the shortest in terms of actual distance.\n",
        "*   **For Finding Any Path/Connectivity:** **DFS** can find a path, but it is highly inefficient for routing in terms of distance and often produces impractical routes.\n",
        "*   **For Complex Optimization:** **Simulated Annealing** is a powerful general-purpose optimization technique, but it is overkill and less efficient for a straightforward shortest path problem that can be solved optimally by algorithms like Dijkstra's. Its higher runtime for a suboptimal solution demonstrates the importance of choosing the right algorithm for the problem at hand.\n",
